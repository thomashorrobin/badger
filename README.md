# badger test

Unfortunately I ran out of time to finish this properly. I didn't get a chance to finish testing or to build the lost scent feature

## how to run

It's a pretty simple go program, all you need to do is `go get github.com/jessevdk/go-flags`

Unfortuntely I didn't get time to sanatise the inputs, so you have to use uppercase yourself or you might get an error

## architecture

there's obviously not much to this because it's only a 3 hour project. However everything to do with grid and robot possition is in the state package. 
In theory, every thing to do with user input is in the main package.
